Unique File Name Comparison Tool
This Python script compares files in two folders and generates an Excel report with the unique file names from both folders. The files are compared based on their file names, and the results are saved in an Excel file. Additionally, the script uses a progress bar to visually indicate the progress of the comparison process.
